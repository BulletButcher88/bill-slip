## Bill Splitter

I wanted to explore making a small game, app for people to play in a resturant. Number of players enter the game... play it and it will slipt the bills based on the final scroe. 


### Unfinished Project  
the work this still requires is storing players scores, while moving onto another player game play. Then a billing amount entrance with a final calculation page.
